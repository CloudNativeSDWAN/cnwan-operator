# CNWAN Operator

Register and manage your Kubernetes Services to a Service Registry.

The CNWAN Operator is part of the Cloud Native SD-WAN (CNWAN) project.
Please check the
[CNWAN documentation](https://github.com/CloudNativeSDWAN/cnwan-docs) for the
general project overview and architecture.
You can contact the CNWAN team at [cnwan@cisco.com](mailto:cnwan@cisco.com).

## Overview

CNWAN Operator is a Kubernetes operator created with [Kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder)
that watches for changes in services deployed in your cluster and registers
them to a service registry so that clients can later discover all registered
services and know how to connect to them properly.

The service registry is populated with only the allowed resources and
properties, as specified from a configuration file.

## Supported Service Registries

Currently, the CNWAN Operator can register and manage Kubernetes services to
Google Cloud's [Service Directory](https://cloud.google.com/service-directory).
The project and region must be provided in the `ConfigMap`, and the service
account file must be provided as a `Secret`.  
Please follow [this section](#configure-the-operator) to learn how to set up
the operator and provide such files.

Register and manage your Kubernetes Services to a Service Registry.

The CN-WAN Operator is part of the Cloud Native SD-WAN (CN-WAN) project. Please check the [CN-WAN documentation](https://github.com/CloudNativeSDWAN/cnwan-docs) for the general project overview and architecture. You can contact the CN-WAN team at [cnwan@cisco.com](mailto:cnwan@cisco.com).

## Overview

CN-WAN Operator is a Kubernetes operator created with [Kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) that watches for changes in services deployed in your cluster and registers them to a service registry so that clients can later discover all registered services and know how to connect to them properly.

The [service registry](./docs/service_registry.md) is populated with only the allowed resources and properties, as specified from a configuration file.

## Supported Service Registries

Currently, the CN-WAN Operator can use the popular key-value storage [etcd](https://etcd.io/) as a service registry or use other commercial solutions like Google Cloud's [Service Directory](https://cloud.google.com/service-directory).

We have a document about this topic so that you can learn more about it and we recommend you to read: [Service registry](./docs/service_registry.md).

If you're undecided or don't know which one to use or just want to try the project, you can try with [etcd](./docs/etcd/concepts.md).

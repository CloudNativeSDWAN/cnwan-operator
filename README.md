# CN-WAN Operator

Register and manage your Kubernetes Services to a Service Registry.

The CN-WAN Operator is part of the Cloud Native SD-WAN (CN-WAN) project. Please check the [CN-WAN documentation](https://github.com/CloudNativeSDWAN/cnwan-docs) for the general project overview and architecture. You can contact the CN-WAN team at [cnwan@cisco.com](mailto:cnwan@cisco.com).

## Overview

CN-WAN Operator is a Kubernetes operator created with [Kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) that watches for changes in services deployed in your cluster and registers them to a service registry so that clients can later discover all registered services and know how to connect to them properly.

The service registry is populated with only the allowed resources and properties, as specified from a configuration file.

## Supported Service Registries

Currently, the CN-WAN Operator can register and manage Kubernetes services to Google Cloud's [Service Directory](https://cloud.google.com/service-directory). The project and region must be provided in the `ConfigMap`, and the service account file must be provided as a `Secret`.  Please follow [this section](#configure-the-operator) to learn how to set up the operator and provide such files.

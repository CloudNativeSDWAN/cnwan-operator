// Package cluster contains code that gets information about the cluster where
// we are running and if it is a managed cluster, e.g. GKE or EKS.
// For example: VPC, SubNetwork, Cluster Name, etc.
//
// Additionally, it also retrieves common objects from Kubernetes, e.g.:
// ConfigMap and Secrets.
